# ShowCrosshair.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert. Depending on your crosshair setting, it shows a crosshair either always, or while you drag your mouse pointer. Switch between states via the conext menu: right click and select *Toggle Crosshair* (de: *Fadenkreuz umschalten*).

After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Crosshair* (de: *Zeige Fadenkreuz*). You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.
