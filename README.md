# ShowCrosshairOnSelect.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert. It is based on [ShowCrosshair](https://github.com/mekkablue/ShowCrosshair) by [mekkablue](https://github.com/mekkablue). After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Crosshair On Select*. You can set a keyboard shortcut in *System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts.*

![Crosshair](ShowCrosshair.png "Show Crosshair Screenshot")

It shows a crosshair when you have something selected, as opposed to the mekkablue version that shows the crosshair at the cursor.

Toggle the display of measurements between intersections with the context menu option *Show Thicknesses*.

![Crosshair options](ToggleCrosshairOptions.png "Toggling Crosshair options in the context menu")

Display the crosshair coordinates (of the cursor) in the lower left corner of the active tab by choosing *Show Coordinates On Select*:

![Coordinates in lower left corner](ToggleCoordinates.png "Coordinates are displayed in the lower left corner of the Edit view")

By default, the coordinate numbers are displayed at a font size of 10 points. Change their size by pasting this line of code into the Macro Window (*Window > Macro Panel*) and pressing the *Run* button:

    Glyphs.defaults["com.wwwhhhhh.ShowCrosshairOnSelect.fontSize"] = 18.0

Change the value (18.0 in this example) to the desired point size.

### Installation

2. Use *View > Show Crosshair On Select* to toggle the display of the crosshair.
